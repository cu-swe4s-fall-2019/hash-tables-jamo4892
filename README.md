Hash Tables

This assignment uses various functions and classes to search and fill hash tables.

hash_functions.py contains functions for assigning a value to an input hash key.

hash_tables.py contains classes and functions for searching and filling a hash table.

This assignment is not yet finished. Existing code and functional tests run without error, but I haven't yet done any comparison with the hash methods. I will continue/redo this assignment for the homework due 10/24.
